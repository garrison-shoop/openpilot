"""Publish the Ford CAN GPS solution as this device's GPS location.

The comma device's ublox GPS can never get a fix in this Mach-E: the
IR-reflective windshield blocks the antenna and there's no uncoated zone to
mount in. The car itself broadcasts a full GPS solution on CAN bus 0 at
~1 Hz (APIMGPS_Data_Nav_1/2/3_FD1, DBC ford_lincoln_base_pt.dbc). This daemon
decodes it and republishes it so system/timed.py, selfdrived.py,
speed_limit_resolver.py, mapd, and athenad all keep working unmodified
(locationd in this tree is camera+IMU only and never reads GPS). The device's
own GPS daemon is gated off elsewhere so msgq's one-publisher-per-topic rule
doesn't collide.

Which topic that is depends on the device, and we do not get to choose: consumers pick
between gpsLocationExternal and gpsLocation on UbloxAvailable (common/gps.py, and
locationd.cc in trees whose locationd reads GPS), so the topic is resolved through the same
get_gps_location_service() the consumers use. gpsLocationExternal where ublox_available()
is true, gpsLocation where it is not. Publishing the other one reaches nobody, which is
what a comma 3X user saw when the toggle appeared to do nothing.

Do not shortcut that to a device model. ublox_available() is a probe, not a lookup: it
tests for /dev/ttyHS0 and for the /persist/comma/use-quectel-gps override, so a board with
both receivers can be flipped either way and one model does not imply one answer. Every
comma 3X is Quectel; the comma 4 this daemon was developed and driven on (model string
"comma mici") probes ublox -- /dev/ttyHS0 present, no override, UbloxAvailable 1, measured
on the device. That is one device, not a claim about every comma 4.

The daemon runs in one of two modes. As the selected GPS source it publishes, as it always
has. Otherwise it runs as an observer: it decodes the same CAN messages but sends nothing,
and instead watches whether the device receiver is producing fixes -- see cangps_fallback,
which owns the decision of when to take the topic over. Decoding CAN costs nothing extra
while the device daemon owns the topic, since the one-publisher rule constrains sending,
not reading.

Decode is split into pure functions (decode_utc, decode_position,
decode_quality) that take plain dicts of already-scaled DBC signal values, so
they can be unit-tested and replayed offline against a recorded rlog without
any cereal sockets -- see comma-gps-time/scripts/decode_can_gps.py.
