"""Publish gpsLocationExternal from the Ford CAN GPS solution.

The comma device's ublox GPS can never get a fix in this Mach-E: the
IR-reflective windshield blocks the antenna and there's no uncoated zone to
mount in. The car itself broadcasts a full GPS solution on CAN bus 0 at
~1 Hz (APIMGPS_Data_Nav_1/2/3_FD1, DBC ford_lincoln_base_pt.dbc). This daemon
decodes it and republishes gpsLocationExternal so system/timed.py,
selfdrived.py, speed_limit_resolver.py, mapd, and athenad all keep working
unmodified (locationd in this tree is camera+IMU only and never reads GPS).
ubloxd is gated off elsewhere so msgq's one-publisher-per-topic rule doesn't
collide.

Decode is split into pure functions (decode_utc, decode_position,
decode_quality) that take plain dicts of already-scaled DBC signal values, so
they can be unit-tested and replayed offline against a recorded rlog without
any cereal sockets -- see comma-gps-time/scripts/decode_can_gps.py.
