"""Pick a GPS source for this car without asking the user.

The problem cangpsd solves is invisible: a windshield that blocks the device's own GPS
antenna produces no error, no alert and no UI -- just routes stamped with the AGNOS flash
date and a nav stack that never sees a position. Nobody goes looking for a toggle for a
failure they have not noticed, so the toggle only ever helps people who already diagnosed
it. This module makes the choice automatically instead.

The two sources are the *device* receiver -- whichever daemon owns it, ubloxd/pigeond or
qcomgpsd, decided by the ublox_available() probe rather than by which comma the code is
running on -- and the car's own GPS on CAN. Which receiver is fitted changes none of the
reasoning here, so the state records "device" rather than naming one.

The rule is deliberately asymmetric. We leave the device receiver in charge until it has
*proven* it cannot work -- many minutes of driving with no fix at all -- and we only switch
away once the car's own CAN GPS has positively shown a fix of its own that we believe. That
ordering matters: a Ford with no 0x462 (or an APIM that never gets a fix of its own) must
never end up worse off than stock, and "the device receiver is quiet" alone is not evidence
that anything else would do better.

Two things make the measurement honest:

  - Only moving time counts. A device sat in a garage for a week is not evidence about an
    antenna, and cold-start TTFF on a working receiver is seconds of driving, not minutes.
  - Any single fix resets the accumulator to zero. One fix means the antenna works; the
    threshold is only ever reached by a receiver that produces nothing at all.

The decision is per-vehicle and keyed on VIN, because a blocked windshield is a property
of one physical car -- moving the device to another car re-tests from scratch.

cangpsd can watch both sources at once even though only one may publish: msgq's
one-publisher-per-topic rule constrains sending on the GPS topic, not decoding CAN. So the
observe mode reads 0x462/0x463 off the bus exactly as it would when publishing, while the
device's own GPS daemon still owns the topic, and the comparison is real rather than
sequential.

# six-minute SR-99 transit) because nothing else stood between a tunnel and a false switch.
# CAN_FIX_MIN_S below now carries that job, and carries it better: a tunnel yields no
# differential evidence however long it lasts, so tunnel protection no longer depends on
# this number at all.
#
# What remains is "do not even evaluate a switch until the incumbent has clearly failed",
# and ten minutes is sized for that. Note what it already excludes for free: the window
# zeroes on a single fix, so cold-start TTFF, brief dropouts and ordinary canyon work can
# never reach any threshold -- getting here needs ten continuous minutes of moving with
# nothing at all. Counting seconds rather than drives matters too: three short errands into
# a covered garage would trip a drive counter, and one long tree-lined commute would not.

# Stop switching after this many changes on one VIN. On a car where neither source works
# the rule above would otherwise alternate forever, one flip per threshold. Three attempts
# is enough to have genuinely tried both, after which the state freezes until the car
# changes.
#
# Note where it freezes: the flips strictly alternate from SOURCE_DEVICE, so the third one
# always lands on SOURCE_CAN. That is deliberate, not an accident of the count -- switching
# *to* CAN requires positive proof that the car has a real fix of its own, while
# switching back to the device receiver requires no such evidence. The transitions toward
# CAN are the better-evidenced ones, so if we must give up somewhere, give up there. An
# even MAX_FLIPS would settle on the device receiver instead; that would be the choice to
# make if resting on stock behaviour ever matters more than resting on the source we have
# actually seen work.

# How much of the no-fix window the car must have covered with a real fix of its own before
# we will switch to it. This is a *differential* measurement -- time where the car had an
# actual fix and the active source had none -- which is the only thing that distinguishes
# the two cases that both end in NO_FIX_TIMEOUT of moving with no fix:
#
#   Blocked windshield: the device receiver produces nothing across the whole window,
#   including long stretches of open sky where the car is fixed the entire time. Minutes of
#   direct head-to-head evidence that one source works here and the other does not.
#
#   Long tunnel, working receiver: outside, both sources are fixed, so any device fix zeroes
#   the window before it can grow. Inside, the device receiver has nothing -- but neither
#   does the car, which is dead reckoning through the same tunnel. The window can only reach
#   the threshold on tunnel time, and tunnel time contributes no differential evidence.
#
# Hence *actual* fixes only: the APIM asserts a fix while inferring (the 15.7% of frames the
# drives found flagged GPS_Actual_vs_Infer_pos), so counting inferred ones would make a
# tunnel look like proof that the car's GPS works underground.
#
# Accumulated across the window rather than sampled at its end, and cumulative rather than
# continuous. Sampling at the end would discard a whole commute's worth of open-sky evidence
# just because the threshold happened to fall inside a tunnel -- and since a refusal restarts
# the window, a tunnel at a fixed point in a commute could defer the switch forever.
#
# Thirty seconds is a low bar deliberately: a genuinely blocked windshield clears it by
# orders of magnitude (minutes to tens of minutes), while the tunnel case sits at zero. It
# exists to reject noise, not to be a hurdle.
