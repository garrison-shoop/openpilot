"""Unit tests for the automatic GPS source selection.

The arbiter is deliberately a pure state machine over
(dt, moving, published_fix, can_actual_fix),
with no sockets or params, so a ten-minute threshold can be exercised in a few hundred
microseconds. The cases that matter are the ones where it must *not* switch: a receiver
that is merely in a tunnel, a car parked for a week, and a Ford whose own GPS is no better
than the one we would be leaving.
